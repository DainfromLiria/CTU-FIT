## Subjects
  * [BIG](/BIG) - _DB Technologies for Big Data_. This folder contains my semester work, which has two parts.
    * The first part is a MongoDB database, and the second part is data analytics of three datasets using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Spark.
  * [JUL](/JUL) - _Programming in Julia_.
    * [hw01](/JUL/hw01) - Catalan number calculation.
    * [hw02](/JUL/hw02) - Max/min eigenvalue calculation.
    * [hw03](/JUL/hw03) - Chaos theory and dynamical billiards.
    * [hw04](/JUL/hw04) - Data analytics on astronomy data.
