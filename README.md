    * The first part is a MongoDB database, and the second part is data analytics of three datasets using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Spark.
  * [JUL](/JUL) - _Programming in Julia_.
    * [hw01](/JUL/hw01) - Catalan number calculation.
    * [hw02](/JUL/hw02) - Max/min eigenvalue calculation.
    * [hw03](/JUL/hw03) - Chaos theory and dynamical billiards.
    * [hw04](/JUL/hw04) - Data analytics on astronomy data.
  * [ML1](/ML1) - _Machine learning 1_.
    * [hw02](/ML1/HW_02_Regrese) - Regression problem on Life expectancy data. Linear and ridge regression. Random forest.
    * [hw03](/ML1/HW_03_Shlukovani) - Clustering. Agglomerative clustering and KMeans. My own implementation of KMeans.
  * [ML2](/ML2) - _Machine Learning 2_.
